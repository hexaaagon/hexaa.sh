description: your own guide to introduct my labs effectively.
---

hello there! hexaa's here. and i'm excited to have you explore my labs. this is my personal space where i tinker with ui components
and design systems. whether you're a developer, designer, or just curious, this guide will help you get started.

## what's in the labs?

my labs are a collection of ui components and design patterns that i've been experimenting with. you'll find buttons, scrolls, component,
and more. each component is built with reusability and accessibility in mind.

## bro what tf is this even for?

the lab serve multiple purposes:

- **learning and experimentation**: it's a playground for me to try out new ideas and techniques.
- **make things easier**: reusable components can speed up development time for future projects.
- **better components**: most of these components are inspired or forked from existing UI, but with my own twist and improvements.
- **resource for developers and designers**: you can use these components in your own projects or get inspiration from them.
- **community contribution**: feel free to suggest improvements or new components!

in case you do a tldr in this short ahh intro, just explore the components section and try them out yourself!

## installation

if you want to use any of the components in your own project, you can just copy the code snippets provided in each component's documentation.
but if you're extra lazy, you can just initialize shadcn instead! this lab is built on top of shadcn/ui registries.

### the good old' way

1. copy the code snippet from the component documentation.
2. follow the instructions (such as installing dependencies or adding styles).
3. paste it into your project.

### the quick way™

1. follow the [shadcn/ui installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).
2. copy paste the command depending your package manager in each component page to add the components you want.
