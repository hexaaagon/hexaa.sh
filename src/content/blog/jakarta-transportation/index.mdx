i've been using jakarta's public transport for the past of this years, roughly 30+ krl commuting, 10+ mrts, 2 lrts, and 15+ buses. and i wanted to share my
thoughts and experiences regarding the system. jakarta has a variety of public transport options, including buses, commuter trains, and the newly introduced MRT system.

nowadays, i took jakarta's public transport atleast once a week, mainly using the commuter line and mrt. today, i want to share my experience using
jakarta's public transport, specifically the commuter line and mrt.

check each line in the map or click the navigation to start!

## memory

so, the first time i've tried jakarta's public transport was around 2024. at that time, i was 13 years old. my older sister took me to jakarta using
the mrt. it was a great experience! i remember how pleased i was riding the mrt for the first time. the train was clean, fast, and efficient. i also
liked how the stations were well-maintained and easy to navigate.

after that, i really, really wanted to try the mrt again! but unfortunately my older sister is busy with her college, so i couldn't go with her again.

fast forward when she had a job in tenjo, my older sister took me to her workplace using the commuter line. it was my first time riding the commuter line,
and i was excited to explore another mode of public transport in jakarta. the commuter line was different from the mrt, but it was still a great experience.

andd it's 2025 now, i've been using jakarta's public transport more frequently by myself. using commuter line, mrt, and transjakarta. i've learned how to navigate
the system, understanding how fares work, and plan my routes. overall, my experience with jakarta's public transport has been positive, and i'm grateful for the
convenience it provides in getting around the city. man i wish my school is near a mrt station tho hehe
